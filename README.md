## About ZibaSec

Weâ€™re an early stage, funded, stealth-mode startup focused on helping organizations improve their security posture through tools that are simple yet robust with a focus on making it harder for attackers to exploit the people within an organization.

At the moment our flagship product is focused on helping organizations run email phishing campaigns against their own employees to assess their risk levels while also providing insight as to what type of training might be necessary for their organization. 

We are a growing company and can promise you the following:

* A diverse organization

* A safe workplace with zero tolerance for discrimination and harassment of any kind

* A solid workstation, your choice of a Linux, Mac, or Windows laptop (the current team is all on Mac, some dual-boot, but we're not dogmatic, if you feel more productive on Windows or Linux, then cool).

* A balanced work life. We actually rather you don't work for more than 40 hours a week. We don't have VCs or other outside entities to answer to, and we rather our people have a balanced life than no life.

* Remote is super okay with us.

* Flexible scheduling. Do you rather work from noon to 8 pm? or early mornings? No problem! (Though we'd still want you to be generally available during a specific 3-hour window).

* That your voice will carry the same weight as anyone else.

* Dedicated time to learn, and a budget to pay for it.

## Core Software Beliefs

* **Testing is important:** Untested code does not get shipped...but hitting 100% unit test coverage can be detrimental to productivity for no or very little gain; it's about the right balance. We're more fond of integration and end-to-end testing.

* **Git activity != actual productivity:** Developers need time to debug locally, research, and learn.

* **Continuous Deployment:** When code is ready, passes tests, it should make it into production within minutes.

* **Readability > clever code.** Slick code isn't so slick if it's hard to grok.

* **Continuous Improvement:** Everything can be improved and nobody knows any code, stack, framework perfectly; there is always room to learn and improve. In fact, we'll provide you with a budget that you can spend on learning (conferences, courses, etc).

* **Dogma is bad:** Some method, technique, etc., may have been the right answer 100 times, but on the 101st time it's possible that another way could be the best path.

* **Open Source is crucial:** As a company, we're very involved with open source, we are active consumers and contributors to multiple projects. We feel so strongly about this that if we find that a particular internal library could be beneficial to the outside world, then we take the time to package it up and open source it as a standalone library (we did exactly this for a Django SAML2 authentication back end).
