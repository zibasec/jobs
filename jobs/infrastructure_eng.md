# Software Engineer (infrastructure and internal-tooling focus)

We’re looking for someone who has experience
* Programmatically building, managing, and maintaining AWS-based infrastructures
* With serverless architectures
* Doing “DevOps” things

We are entering a phase in our development where we need someone who is hyper-focused on infrastructure matters as we build out more features and services for our platform. 

For application logic we use Serverless Framework and the Architect (node) framework for deployment serverless stacks on AWS. For other bits, we use Terraform.

Some days you’d be working directly with the founders to architect the backend for new features. Other days you’d be working directly with our application developers to help improve the performance of their stacks. And sometimes you’d be hitting our Zapier stack to help our business operate more efficiently.

* Very comfortable with BASH
* Experience in creating, deploying, and maintaining production serverless (or distributed) infrastructures, ideally in an AWS environment

    * Golang
    * Linux
  * Working with the AWS SDK
  * Writing CLIs
  * CI/CD architectures
    * Including developing CI-server workflows
  * Terraform (or something similar like Ansible, etc)
* Strong communication skills
* Strong working knowledge of git and GitHub
* A desire to learn about infosec concepts like social engineering

#### We’d be especially interested in you if:
* You’ve contributed to any infrastructure or security automation project in the open source world
* Have experience in 
  * observability and tracing
  * Chaos engineering
  * AWS Lambda + AWS API Gateway
  * Zapier
* Have worked under the restrictions of FedRAMP
