# Javascript Developer (frontend focus)

We're looking for folks with hands-on experience in web application development with JavaScript/Nodejs. This role is not likely suitable for folks with less than 5 years of experience.

While would like to your help with the backend from time-to-time, this role will be mostly focused on the frontend of the house. We'd like for you to be comfortable with nodejs but an expert on the frontend.

We plan to standardize on `preact` with `htm` (versus JSX), and have already built out our initial storybook + component library setup. You'd be working closely with our UI/UX designer to develop out our component library and also with various other team members as we ship new features.

## Core Requirements

* High JS proficiency. You should be feel very comfortable writing vanilla JavaScript without frameworks while also having experience working in the React/Preact ecosystem. 

* Nodejs fundamentals. While your core responsbility would be to our frontend, we would want to leverage you for backend work sometimes.

* Strong working knowledge of Git/GitHub

* Strong communication skills

## Bonus Items

Additionally, we'd really be interested if you have ever directly dealt with or used any of the following.

* Any serverless framework/methodology

* Programmatic emails/sms/etc

* Continuous Integration/Deployment (CircleCI)

* A desire to learn about infosec concepts

* Working with (or maintaining) open source projects

* Developing CLI utilities

* AWS experience in production
